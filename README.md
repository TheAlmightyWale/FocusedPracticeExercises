## Focused Practice Overview

Focused practice is a very intentional approach to learning, it essentially involves you breaking down a subject or target of learning into lots of small parts and then quickly and iteratively practicing and refining your knowledge on each of those sections in turn. Finally you can bring everything together. 

In general for each of the exercises listed here we will try to follow the formula of laying out a specific goal we are trying to achieve with this challenge, be specific about requirements and what a working solution looks like to enable good feedback and then to provide stretch challenges that add complexity or some form of twist on the original challenge to help extend our learning.

We can essentially target two forms of practice. The general skills that are applicable to any form of programming problem (e.g. deciding on responsibilities, actual implementation of requirements, relationships of components) and then exploring specific domains to understand the problems they have and the solutions that exist.

### General Skills

There are several skills that can be focused on here.

- Internal class implementations. Taking complicated requirements for a set of functionality and then choosing the correct data structures and algorithms to use to implement them.
- Class to class interfaces. Taking complicated requirements and then breaking those into smaller pieces and their relationships to each other. We want classes to follow SOLID principles, but still be easy to express what their calling clients are trying to achieve.

#### Class Implementations

- Hashmaps
- LRU cache
- LFU cache
- escape special characters
